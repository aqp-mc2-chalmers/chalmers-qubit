# Multi-qubit gates

two-qubit gates are performed using a time-dependent coupling term of the form 

\begin{equation}
    g(t)(a^\dagger_ia_j+a^\dagger_ja_i),
\end{equation}

with 

\begin{equation}
    g(t) = g_0 \cos(\omega_d t),
\end{equation}

where $\omega_d$ is the driving frequency, and $g_0$ is the amplitude.

## Example
To perform a CZ-gate betweem
